# Polars vs Pandas: Boost Your ETL Performance

Handling large volumes of data in real-time presents significant challenges in terms of productivity and time management. Efficient solutions are crucial for data scientists working with BIG DATA, especially in complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. This repository provides a comprehensive comparison between Polars and Pandas and some important funstions of both libraries, demonstrating how Polars can enhance data processing efficiency by up to 95%.

## Introduction

As a data scientist working with Python, managing BIG DATA can be daunting. The large volumes of data involved required a more efficient and less complicated solution.

**ü§î Just Use Pandas! Right?**

Many data scientists rely on Pandas for data processing and manipulation. While it's an essential tool, it can struggle with BIG DATA in complex ETL pipelines.

**üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è Discovering Polars**

That's when I found Polars. Despite its similar name, Polars is incredibly powerful and efficient, [claiming up to 30x better performance in data querying and manipulation]([url](https://pola.rs/posts/benchmarks/)).
I'm not sure about this results, so i dicided to create a repository that i could text both Pnadas and Polars in my machine.

## Getting Started

To get started with Polars and see the performance comparisons yourself, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/danielsbraga/polars_pandas.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Comparison Tests**
    ```sh
    python compare_polars_pandas.py
    ```

## Detailed Test Results and Usage

üí™ **How Powerful is Polars? Here's What I Found**

I conducted several tests to compare Polars and Pandas, and here are the key findings:

- **Code Similarity**: Methods like `read_csv()`, `head()`, etc., are very similar between the two libraries, making it easy for Pandas users to transition to Polars.
- **Data Visualization**: The visualization of tables (DataFrame and Series) is almost the same, but Polars offers a clearer representation in some cases.
- **Ease of Transformation**: You can transform a DataFrame from Pandas to Polars and vice-versa with a single command.
- **Performance**: Polars outperformed Pandas in all performance-related tasks involving data queries:
  - Data Loading: 83% faster
  - Filtering: 72% faster
  - Aggregation: 45% faster
  - JOIN operations: 93% faster
  - Data Transformation: 95% faster
  - Sorting: 63% faster
  - Window Functions: 94% faster
